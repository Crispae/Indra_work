      <abstract>
        <p>Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have been present on Earth for over 2 billion years, and can produce a variety of bioactive molecules, such as cyanotoxins. Microcystins (MCs), the most frequently detected cyanotoxins, pose a threat to the aquatic environment and to human health. The classic toxic mechanism of MCs is the inhibition of the protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A). Immunity is known as one of the most important physiological functions in the neuroendocrine-immune network to prevent infections and maintain internal homoeostasis in fish. The present review aimed to summarize existing papers, elaborate on the MC-induced immunotoxicity in fish, and put forward some suggestions for future research. The immunomodulatory effects of MCs in fish depend on the exposure concentrations, doses, time, and routes of exposure. Previous field and laboratory studies provided strong evidence of the associations between MC-induced immunotoxicity and fish death. In our review, we summarized that the immunotoxicity of MCs is primarily characterized by the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A, oxidative stress, immune cell damage, and inflammation, as well as apoptosis. The advances in fish immunoreaction upon encountering MCs will benefit the monitoring and prediction of fish health, helping to achieve an ecotoxicological goal and to ensure the sustainability of species. Future studies concerning MC-induced immunotoxicity should focus on adaptive immunity, the hormesis phenomenon and the synergistic effects of aquatic microbial pathogens.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Cyanobacteria are the oldest known oxygenic photoautotroph on earth. The proliferation of cyanobacteria between 2.45 and 2.32 billion years ago greatly changed the foregoing anoxic biosphere by producing oxygen and accelerating the evolution of higher flora and fauna [<xref rid="B1-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many genera of cyanobacteria can regulate atmospheric nitrogen and store phosphorus, which enables them to adapt to multiple geographical conditions, including aquatic and terrestrial environments [<xref rid="B3-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the aquatic environmental and hydrological alterations caused by anthropogenic activities have given rise to a series of serious environmental problems [<xref rid="B5-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent decades, the frequency of harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) increased due to eutrophication and climate changes [<xref rid="B7-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The deleterious outcomes of these blooms cause the loss of water clarity, which negatively affects aquatic plants, phytoplankton, and zooplankton [<xref rid="B8-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The decomposition of CyanoHABs can also result in oxygen depletion, and subsequently lead to fish death [<xref rid="B10-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A variety of cyanobacterial species also produce toxic secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) during cell lysis associated with natural aging or environmental stress, which can greatly induce toxic effects in aquatic food webs (<xref rid="toxins-13-00765-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among various classes of cyanotoxins, MCs are the most widespread in freshwater environments. Until now, over 270 different MC congeners have been determined, and Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), Microcystin-RR (MC-RR), and Microcystin-YR (MC-YR) are the three of most concern and widely studied [<xref rid="B11-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The molecular formula and molecular weight of the three commonly distributed MCs are shown in <xref rid="toxins-13-00765-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. MC-LR is the most toxic and abundant structural congener in freshwater, followed by MC-RR and MC-YR [<xref rid="B14-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As one of the most toxic and commonly distributed variants, MC-LR is a great worldwide concern due to its acute poisonous lethal effects and chronic carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B16-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. According to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), the maximum concentration of MC-LR should not exceed 1 μg/L in drinking water [<xref rid="B18-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in order to be safe; the MC-LR concentrations in natural waters are normally within the scope of 0.1 to 10 μg/L [<xref rid="B19-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is difficult to degrade MC-LR in water during an algal bloom, which could greatly impact the normal function of aquatic organisms and terrestrial organisms [<xref rid="B20-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>The inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A is the classic toxic mechanism of MCs, tightly associated with their cytotoxicity and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B25-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress plays a vital role in the MC-induced hepatotoxicity, mainly characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depletion of glutathione [<xref rid="B28-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order to alleviate the negative effects from oxidative stress, an antioxidant system developed in aquatic organisms. This system produces antioxidant substances, including enzymatic components such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and non-enzymatic components, such as glutathione (GSH) [<xref rid="B29-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Increasing evidence has shown that MCs mainly accumulate in the liver and cause hepatotoxicity, but immune organs, such as the spleen and head kidney, are also vulnerable to MCs exposure [<xref rid="B30-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Many studies have found that MCs can exert toxic effects on lymphocytes as well as phagocytes, subsequently resulting in immune dysfunction. In an in vitro study, Rymuszka et al. [<xref rid="B33-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] suggested that the proliferation of isolated splenic lymphocytes of rainbow trout (<italic toggle="yes">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) exhibited a significant decrease in the 40 mg/mL MC- LR group while a significant increase in the 1 mg/mL MC-LR group. In an in vivo experiment, Wei et al. [<xref rid="B34-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found a significant downregulation of the immune-related genes in the spleen and head kidney when grass carp (<italic toggle="yes">Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic>) were injected with 50 μg/kg MC-LR. Hence, MCs were proven to disturb fish immune function, which could increase their susceptibility to pathogens and eventually result in fish death.</p>
      <p>The immune system is a collaborative network of immunological molecules, immune cells, and lymphoid organs, and is hypersensitive to toxic substances [<xref rid="B35-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is thought that MCs can enter the immune organs and cause immunotoxicity [<xref rid="B36-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the details of the mechanism of MC-induced immunotoxicity in fish are still incomplete. The aim of this scoping review is to organize the existing works involving the immunotoxicity of MCs in fish and to summarize the potential mechanism of MC-induced immune dysfunction. The present literature review was conducted using PubMed (<uri xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</uri> (accessed on 26 October 2021)) with the goal of identifying related articles.</p>

      <title>2. Immune System of Fish</title>
      <p>The fish immune system is divided into innate (non-specific) immunity and adaptive (specific) immunity. Innate immunity substantially acts as the hosts’ first line of defense against external pathogens, while specific immunity exerts a key role to prevent recurrent infections by generating membrane-bound receptors and memory cells [<xref rid="B37-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Fish are known as the earliest vertebrates with both specific and non-specific immunity, though their adaptive immunity is not as developed as the higher vertebrates [<xref rid="B38-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The innate immunity to antigens relies on the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref rid="B40-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Numerous PRRs have been extensively studied, including the Toll-like pattern recognition receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and Nod-like pattern recognition receptors (NLRs) [<xref rid="B41-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The host’s PPRs activate immune signaling pathways when they recognize the conserved structure of PAMPs, subsequently resulting in an inflammatory response [<xref rid="B43-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>The fish immune organs include the thymus, head kidney, spleen, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which provide proper sites for immune cells to differentiate and proliferate [<xref rid="B45-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The thymus is the main site of differentiation and maturation of the T lymphocytes, which are mainly responsible for cellular immune function [<xref rid="B46-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The head kidney is responsible for hematopoietic and immune functions in fish [<xref rid="B37-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B47-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The spleen is an important site for the production and maturation of various erythrocytes and granulocytes [<xref rid="B48-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of fish mainly consists of the skin-, gill-, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which can induce a local immune response and function [<xref rid="B49-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>Fish immune cells, including lymphocytes and phagocytes, mainly distribute in the blood, lymphatic fluid, and immune organs [<xref rid="B50-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. T cells are responsible for mediating cellular immunity, while B cells are involved in the synthesis of antibodies in humoral immunity [<xref rid="B52-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Zwollo et al. [<xref rid="B54-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] found that the maturation, metastasis, and response of B cells in bony fish are similar to those of mammals. The phagocytes of fish mainly include monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which can phagocytize senile cells and foreign bodies through deformation movement [<xref rid="B55-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
      <p>A variety of immune molecules including cytokines, lysozymes, and the complement system also play an important role in the immune function of fish [<xref rid="B57-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Lysozyme is widely found in the macrophage, serum, and mucus, and can destroy Gram-positive bacteria cells [<xref rid="B60-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Kong et al. [<xref rid="B61-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found that the lysozyme activity exhibited a significant increase when fish were exposed to infectious bacteria or other stress factors. The complement system, which plays a vital role in clearing the potential pathogens in the host, can activate various immune function processes, like phagocytosis, pathogen cytolysis and inflammation [<xref rid="B62-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The activation of the complement system consists of the classical pathway, lection pathway and alternative pathway, which are responsible for the target identification and protease complex formation for the complement component C3 activation [<xref rid="B65-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>

In a long-term study, crucian carp (<italic toggle="yes">Carassius auratus</italic>) were fed diets containing 20% and 40% of cyanobacteria lyophilized powder made from <italic toggle="yes">Microcystis</italic> (equivalent to 1.41 mg/g MCs dry weight) and collected from Lake Dianchi (Yunnan, China) [<xref rid="B67-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. After an exposure of 30 days, splenic hyperemia and hemorrhages were observed in the 40% group. Lysozyme activity showed a significant increase in the 20% group, but a significant decrease in the 40% group, indicating that fish immunity exhibited immunostimulation at low MCs doses, but was immunosuppressive at high MC doses. In another study, blunt snout bream (<italic toggle="yes">Megalobrama amblycephala</italic>) were fed diets containing 15% and 30% of cyanobacteria lyophilized powder for 30 d [<xref rid="B68-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. After the exposure, the edematous mitochondria of head kidney lymphocytes, as well as a decreased phagocytosis activity of macrophages, were observed.</p>
          <p>In addition to oral feeding, immersion is also utilized to investigate the immunotoxicity on fish. Hematological indices are reliable indicators to evaluate the immune function. In an acute study, Kopp and Heteša [<xref rid="B69-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] suggested that various blood indices like total protein (TP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) exhibited a remarkable increase in juvenile carp when exposed to cyanobacteria blooms. Kopp et al. [<xref rid="B70-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] demonstrated that numerous plasma indicators including albumin (ALB), cholesterol (CHOL), glucose (GLU), creatinine (CRE), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and TP showed a significant decrease when silver carp (<italic toggle="yes">Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</italic>) were exposed to cyanobacteria cells containing 2.8–4.7 μg MCs. In a long-term field study, silver carp were collected monthly during a <italic toggle="yes">Microcystis</italic> bloom period in Lake Taihu, and MC contents were detected in the fish kidney [<xref rid="B71-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The nephritic ultrastructural damages were mainly characterized by the dilation of bowman’s space and lysosomes proliferation. The nephritic antioxidant enzyme activities exhibited a dramatic increase, implying the antioxidant system was activated to alleviate oxidative stress.</p>

Rymuszka and Adaszek [<xref rid="B73-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] reported that cyanobacteria extract can cause ROS overproduction, as well as lymphocytes proliferation inhibition in the blood and head kidney of common carp (<italic toggle="yes">Cyprinus carpio</italic> L.). The upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) gene expression were observed when exposed to an MC-containing extract.

In an acute study, a significant increase in serum ALT, AST, lysozyme activity, complement C3, and the cytokines contents including TNFα, IL1β, and IFNγ were observed when silver carp intraperitoneally injected with MC-LR [<xref rid="B75-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In a chronic study, Chen et al. [<xref rid="B76-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] demonstrated that IP injection of 150 μg/kg MC-LR can result in a significant decrease in serum complement C3 and lysozyme activity. However, antioxidant indexes like CAT, SOD, GPx, and LPO levels were remarkably increased, suggesting the antioxidant system was activated in the common carp. MCs exposure can also induce changes in immune parameters in organs, except alterations in hematological biochemical indicators. Grass carp were IP injected with 50 μg/kg/d MC-LR, and the spleen and head kidney were sampled at 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 d [<xref rid="B34-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After exposure, the chromatin compaction, mitochondria edema, and apoptotic lymphocytes were found in the spleen and head kidney. In another study, Li et al. [<xref rid="B77-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] found MC-LR could significantly upregulate the mRNA levels of interleukin-8 (<italic toggle="yes">il8</italic>), a classic inflammatory gene, in bighead carp (<italic toggle="yes">Aristichthys nobilis</italic>) in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, grass carp were IP injected with 25, 75, and 100 μg/kg MC-LR [<xref rid="B78-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Transcription levels of cytokine signaling 3 (<italic toggle="yes">soc3</italic>) and heat shock protein 70 (<italic toggle="yes">hsp70</italic>) showed a significant increase after 96 h of exposure, indicating an activation of the defense system. The oxidant-antioxidant balance is vital for immune function in fish. In an acute study, Okogwu et al. [<xref rid="B79-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] reported that IP injection of MC-RR at 50 and 200 μg/kg MC-LR for 48 h could significantly decrease the nephritic total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and GPx activities in gold fish (<italic toggle="yes">Carassius auratus</italic>). Similarly, Prieto et al.

          <p>For immersion cases, Li et al. [<xref rid="B81-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] demonstrated that acute exposure of 800 μg/L MC-LR could interfere with lymphocytes deferrization and TCR/ig arrangement in zebrafish (<italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic>) larvae by upregulating early lymphoid development genes, including recombination activation gene-1 (Rag1), recombination activation gene-2 (Rag2), Ikaros, GATA1, Lck, and T-cell receptor-α (TCRα). In a sub-chronic study, nucleus deformation and edematous mitochondria were noticed in the spleen when zebrafish were exposed to 20 μg/L MC-LR [<xref rid="B82-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The mRNA levels of splenic interferon-1 (<italic toggle="yes">ifn1</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">il8</italic>, interleukin-1β (<italic toggle="yes">il1β</italic>), and tumor necrosis factor-α (<italic toggle="yes">tnfα</italic>) exhibited a significant increase in the 1 and 20 μg/L groups. In our previous study, male zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of MC-LR for 30 d. Lin et al. [<xref rid="B31-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found that the number of melano-macrophage centers and serum complement C3 levels and splenic complement component C3b (<italic toggle="yes">c3b</italic>) expression showed a significant increase in the low MC-LR exposure groups (0.3, 1, and 3 μg/L). However, the degeneration of splenic macrophages and lymphocytes, and the remarkable decrease in C3 levels were observed in the high MC-LR exposure groups (10 and 30 μg/L). These findings indicated MC-LR exhibits diverse influence on the fish immune system, which is characterized by an inflammatory activation in the low MC-LR exposure groups, but immune inhibition in the high MC-LR exposure groups. Lin et al. [<xref rid="B83-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] found chronic inflammation and immune disorders induced by MC-LR may be mediated through the myeloid differential protein-88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR/MyD88) signaling pathway. These findings indicated that MCs could cause varied influences on the antioxidant system and the innate immune system in fish, which may greatly depend on the exposure routes and concentrations/doses. Furthermore, Falfushynska et al. [<xref rid="B84-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] demonstrated that 20 μg/L MC-LR could induce multifaceted toxic effects including oxidative stress and apoptosis in zebrafish, which characterized by the increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels and caspase-3a (<italic toggle="yes">cas3a</italic>) and caspase-3b (<italic toggle="yes">cas3b</italic>).</p>

        <p>The in vitro studies of pure microcystins induced immunotoxicity on fish are summarized in <xref rid="toxins-13-00765-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In an acute study, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B85-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] assessed the induction of apoptosis by environmentally relevant levels of MC-LR and MC-RR on crucian carp lymphocytes. Apoptotic features characterized by apoptotic bodies formation and nuclear chromatin condensation were observed in the 1, 5, and 10 nM MC-LR or MC-RR groups, which indicated that MCs could result in lymphocytes apoptosis. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B86-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] demonstrated MC-induced apoptosis was tightly associated with ATP depletion and ROS overproduction, which implied that mitochondria and oxidative stress play a vital role in MC-induced toxicity on crucian carp lymphocytes. In another study, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B87-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] found that 10 nM MC-RR could result in ATP depletion and ROS elevation, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential disruption in crucian carp lymphocytes. These findings revealed that the alteration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP are closely associated with MC-induced apoptosis. Similarly, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B88-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] demonstrated that the apoptotic pathway was stimulated, and antioxidant defense system were impaired in crucian carp lymphocytes under MC-LR exposure, which confirmed that apoptosis always come along with oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>To investigate the effects of MC-LR on the cell proliferation, rainbow trout lymphocytes were isolated from immune organs and peripheral blood, then exposed to 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL MC-LR [<xref rid="B33-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Lymphocytes’ proliferation showed a significant increase in the 1 mg/mL MC-LR group but a significant decrease in the 40 mg/mL MC-LR group, which implied that the applied doses caused different immunomodulatory effects. In another study, phagocytic cells were separated from the blood of rainbow trout and exposed to 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg/mL MC-LR [<xref rid="B89-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The results indicated that MC-LR could decrease phagocytic cell numbers in a concentration- and time-dependent pattern, and a possible reason for such cytotoxic activity might be associated with oxidative stress. ROS overproduction and GSH reduction in <italic toggle="yes">C. idellus</italic> kidney (CIK) cells, as well as a reduced cell viability, were observed when exposed to 100 μg/L MC-LR for 48 h, which indicated that the oxidative stress and cytoskeletal disruption may have had a mutual effect on inducing renal toxicity [<xref rid="B90-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p>
        <p>Head kidney cells from omnivorous carp were isolated and exposed to 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μg/mL pure MC-LR to evaluate the possible effects of MC-LR on their immune functions [<xref rid="B91-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The phagocytes’ metabolic activity exhibited an inhibitory effect in the high MC-LR group, while a stimulatory effect in the low MC-LR group was observed. These results suggested that the increased MC-LR concentrations could disturb the immunologic homeostasis of the fish body and subsequently lead to an elevated susceptibility. Moreover, Rymuszka et al. [<xref rid="B92-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] demonstrated that MC-LR induced apoptosis and necrosis in common carp lymphocytes. In another study, blood and head kidney leukocytes were isolated from carp, then exposed to 0.01 and 0.1 μg/mL MC-LR for 4 h [<xref rid="B93-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (<italic toggle="yes">tnfα</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">il1β</italic>) showed a significant downregulation, while anti-inflammatory cytokines (<italic toggle="yes">il10</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">tgfβ</italic>) showed a significant upregulation.

Due to the high molecular weight of MCs, their uptake and accumulation in fish occurs through active transport [<xref rid="B95-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Both field and laboratory experiments have proven that MCs can accumulate in the spleen, and then interfere with the immune function [<xref rid="B36-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B96-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].

The differential expression of Oatp subtypes results in a varying tissue distribution of MCs in fish.

Our previous study found that the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of apoptotic genes increased significantly in the zebrafish spleen when exposed to MC-LR [<xref rid="B83-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Researchers believe that MC-LR exposure could induce ROS formation and lipid peroxidation, which eventually results in cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B134-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Up until now, increasing evidence has confirmed that MC-induced apoptosis was tightly associated with the ROS generation [<xref rid="B135-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Rymuszka and Adaszek [<xref rid="B73-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] indicated that the cyanobacterial extracts can induce apoptosis in common carp, which was confirmed by the increase in caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities in lymphocytes. The endoplasmic reticulum pathway is also involved in the MC-induced apoptosis [<xref rid="B136-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. These results demonstrated that the apoptosis of lymphocytes and phagocytes could be one of the potential mechanisms of MC-induced immunotoxicity on fish.</p>

        <title>5.1. Adaptive Immunity</title>
        <p>Fish mainly depend on the innate immunity in the early stage, while the adaptive immunity is less developed [<xref rid="B58-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. An increasing number of studies were carried out to evaluate the MC-induced innate immunity in fish, and the research related to adaptive immunity was usually neglected because of experiment difficulties. The adaptive immunity, including humoral and cellular immunity, normally starts with a specific antigen-antibody recognition [<xref rid="B137-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>,<xref rid="B138-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. The adaptive immunity normally takes days to develop when the body is invaded by pathogens [<xref rid="B139-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The identification of the specific molecules allows for a faster and stronger adaptive immunity when exposed to the same pathogen. More studies should be conducted to focus on MC-induced adaptive immunity.</p>

        <title>5.2. Multi-Omics Study</title>
        <p>In consideration of the organisms’ complexities and the potential interactions between various environmental stressors or factors, classic techniques are far from adequate to explore the in-depth immunotoxicity involving MCs. High-throughput analytical technologies, including metabolomics, proteomics, and genomics, need to be organized and utilized to carry out toxicological studies [<xref rid="B140-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,<xref rid="B141-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Lin et al. [<xref rid="B83-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] demonstrated that the regulatory pathways concerning signal transduction were differentially regulated in the zebrafish spleen via a transcriptomic analysis, and the TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway was significantly activated to induce chronic inflammation. An increasing number of studies are being conducted to assess MC-induced toxicity in fish by using the ‘omics’ methodology [<xref rid="B78-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B142-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,<xref rid="B143-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms of the MC-induced immunotoxicity through multi-omics studies must be elucidated by combining the immune regulation pathways with the classic immune indices.

        <title>5.3. Hormesis Phenomenon</title>
        <p>The dose–response relationship is a basic concept in toxicological studies [<xref rid="B144-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. The word ‘hormesis’ is used to describe a biphasic variation tendency, which is characterized by a high dose inhibition and a low dose stimulation; this gradually became a key concept in biological sciences and played a critical role in environmental risk assessment [<xref rid="B145-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In view of the specific dose–response phenomenon, it is extremely important to determine the concentration threshold of the dosage effects [<xref rid="B146-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Several previous studies observed a hormesis phenomenon in MCs exposure tests. Rymuszka et al. [<xref rid="B33-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found that lymphocytes’ proliferation showed a significant increase when exposed to low-concentrations of MC-LR, but a significant decrease when exposed to high-concentrations of MC-LR. Similarly, low-dose cyanobacteria lyophilized powder resulted in increased lysozyme activity in crucian carp, while high-dose cyanobacteria lyophilized power led to results of the opposite trends [<xref rid="B67-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In our former study, zebrafish immune systems exhibited a dualistic tendency when sub-chronically exposed to different concentrations of pure MC-LR [<xref rid="B31-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Very few studies provide a comprehensive explanation of such biphasic consequences, and thus future studies should explore the inner-most mechanism.</p>

        <title>5.4. Variants Other than MC-LR</title>
        <p>MC-LR is the most distributed variant, followed by MC-RR and MC-YR from over 270 identified MCs variants [<xref rid="B11-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B147-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. For MC congeners, other than MC-LR, there are limited data concerning their toxicity and occurrence in the scientific literature [<xref rid="B148-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that tilapia and goldfish IP injected with MC-RR developed nephritic oxidative stress [<xref rid="B79-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Numerous variants such as MC-LF and MC-LW have more lipophilic compounds than MC-LR, which indicates that other variants can be more toxic than MC-LR. Higher concentrations of variants such as MC-YR and MC-LF were detected instead of MC-LR and MC-RR in field studies, which implies that the toxicity of the lesser-known minority MC congeners require more attention [<xref rid="B149-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. A realistic risk evaluation should be based on the toxicity contribution of other variants, not merely on MC-LR for future immunotoxicity studies, e.g., MC-YR, MC-LF, MC-LA, and the mixtures.</p>

        <title>5.5. Microbial Pathogens in Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
        <p>Various kinds of microbial pathogens exist in natural waters, which could pose a threat to fish. Cyanobacteria bloom and their mucilaginous layers can be treated as a cozy microenvironment for microbial pathogens, which pose a joint threat to fish immune function [<xref rid="B12-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a sub-chronic study, Palikova et al. [<xref rid="B150-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] found that a single cyanobacterial biomass, or the presence of white spot disease (<italic toggle="yes">Ichthyophthirius multifiliis</italic>), created a stimulating effect on the immune response, while the combined group caused immunosuppression in common carp. Polikova et al. [<xref rid="B151-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] demonstrated that a cyanobacterial biomass enhanced the severity of the immune dysfunction of common carp injected with <italic toggle="yes">Carp sprivivirus</italic>, which indicated that the co-exposure to cyanobacteria and virus worsened the fish immunity. Such evidence proved that the synergistic effects of MCs and microbial pathogens should not be neglected.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>As the immune system plays a vital role in maintaining a balance between MC-induced toxicity and an organisms’ survival strategy, more attention must be paid to the immune response when facing an exogenous threat. We made a comprehensive review compiled of existing research concerning MC-induced immunotoxicity on fish. These studies exhibited a tight association between immunotoxicity and MCs exposure doses and routes. MCs can induce an inflammatory response and lead to immune dysfunction by impairing immunocytes and influencing the secretion of immune molecules. The possible mechanisms of MC-induced immunotoxicity are summarized in <xref rid="toxins-13-00765-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, implying that MC exposure poses a critical threat to the immune function of fish. Moreover, our recent study found that the parental exposure to MC-LR could interfere with the immune function of F1 larvae, which indicated that MCs could result in cross-generational immunotoxicity [<xref rid="B152-toxins-13-00765" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The alterations in immune parameters can be treated as reliable indicators to assess the health of fish following MCs exposure. Investigating the immunotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms of MCs is not only crucial for aquatic environment evaluation, but also for the sustainable development of fish populations in the future.</p>

        <p>A schematic review of the immunotoxicity of MCs on fish. MCs are specific inhibitors of serine/threonine PP1 and PP2A, which result in the imbalance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of crucial proteins, subsequently causing abnormal cellular proliferation and cytoskeleton organization damages. MCs exposure is also related to the ROS overproduction and oxidative stress in immune organs, which results in apoptosis and immune dysfunction. MC-induced immunotoxicity greatly depends on exposure routes, time, and concentrations/doses.</p>
